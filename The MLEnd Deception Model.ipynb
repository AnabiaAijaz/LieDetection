    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem involves developing a predictive model to determine a 30-second audio recording is true or deceptive. This is challenging because it not only involves analysing complex audio signals but also pose issues like background noise and inconsistent recording quality, variability in speakers' accents and styles, limited data, the complexity of extracting reliable acoustic features, and potential biases because of limited diversity in the dataset. However, this project is exciting because it could lead to further research in lie detection models that might be useful in areas like security and law enforcement agencies."

    "# 3 Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology involves mapping audio features (predictor attributes) to the corresponding labels (true or deceptive) by using classification supervised learning techniques. For this purpose the MLEnd deception dataset is used, which consisit of 100 audio recordings with three attributes namely a complex audio signal, descriptive labels and binary labels. A dataset is also provided with audio file name, language and labels however for this project it was not used.  For our convience First we will split the audio recordings as per the input requirement of 30-sec duration. However, this recordings cannot be fed directly to our model as audio signals are complex datatypes having continuous waveforms that represent sound over time. To convert them into a digital form, they are sampled at a specific rate, called the sampling frequency, which determines how many data points (samples) are recorded per second. Each sample captures the amplitude of the sound wave at a specific moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using librosa.load(sr=None), we can get the original audio sampling frequency which is 44,100 Hz, meaning there are 44,100 samples per second. For a 30-second recording, this gives us 1,323,000 samples. If we feed this directly into our model, we would be working with a high-dimensional dataset, which can lead to issues like overfitting due to insufficient samples for training. To manage this, we will be extracting key features after which we perform the training, validation and test task. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training task:** Trained the model to recognise patterns or relationships from the extracted features of our audio data by adjusting its parameters based on labeled examples in the training dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Task:** Evaluated different model's performance and their hyperparameters on unseen data during training to identify the best-performing model, avoid overfitting and helps in model optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, K-fold cross-validation is used to reduce reliance on a single validation set. The dataset is divided into 10 folds; the model is trained on 9 folds and tested on the 10th, repeating this process for all folds. This ensures efficient use of available data and unbiased evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Task:** Estimated the deployment quality of a model on unseen data. It is performed only once after building our model to see how the model behaves in real world scenario on unknown data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be evaluated based on the following quality metrics to detect whether a recording is true or deceptive. Since the dataset has true as 0(negative) and deceptive as 1(positive) so the interpretation of the quality metrics are based on that. However, later in our code we displayed the metrics for both classes seperately\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy:** Proportion of correctly classified samples both true and deceptive. <br>\n",
    "**Error Rate:** Proportion of misclassified samples both true and deceptive. It is the complement of accuracy ie the model failure rate so we will not be calculating it seperately for our models. <br>\n",
    "​**Confusion Matrix (Count/Rate):** A table that summarizes the number/rate of true positives(correctly predicted deceptive(1)), true negatives(correctly predicted true(0)), false positives(incorrectly predicted deceptive(1)), and false negatives(incorrectly predicted true(0)) <br>\n",
    "**Recall (Sensitivity):** Proportion of actual deceptive samples correctly classified as deceptive. It helps to minimize the risk of missing a deceptive recording (false negatives) <br>\n",
    "**Specificity:** Proportion of actual true samples correctly classified. It helps assess how well the model avoids incorrectly identifying a true recording as deceptive. <br>\n",
    "**Precision:** Proportion of predicted deceptive samples that are actually deceptive. It helps assess that when the model predicts a recording as deceptive, it is indeed deceptive and not a false alarm <br>\n",
    "**F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing false positives(deceptive) and false negatives(true). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Interpretation**\n",
    "For eg in scenarios such as security and law enforcement applications, a high recall means real threats or crimes are identified whereas a high precision ensures that the system is accurate in identifying only real threats or crimes, avoiding wasting resources. However, the high precision might come at the cost of missing some positive cases (low recall), meaning that some true threats or crimes might go undetected. Therefore a F1 Score balances them both in which a High F1-score indicates that it can identify threats or criminal activities without overwhelming the system with false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis we used Accuracy, Confusion Matrix (Count/Rate), Recall, Precision and F1 Score as the quality metrics."

    "The final evaluation is done on the reserved unseen test data and the following quality metrics were obtained.\n",
    "A low accuracy of 34.3%, with similar but weak performance for both classes (class 0: precision 0.37, recall 0.32; class 1: precision 0.32, recall 0.37). The F1-scores of 0.34 for both classes indicate that the model struggles to effectively differentiate between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "- The model doesnot seem to generalise well as the performance was slightly better on the training and validation set. However, considerable low performance on the unseen test set of 0.3. If we perform a not function on our predications, we will end up with better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions for improvements:\n",
    "- Enhanced features: Include additional audio features such as speech rate, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs),\n",
    "- Advance Models: Use of deep neural networks to capture complex patterns. Further we can utilize transfer learning with pretrained models such as DeepSpeech or Wav2Vec 2.0.\n",
    "- Cross validation: Use K-fold cross validation to ensure robust model performance\n",
    "- Hyperparameter optimization: Utilize wide range of grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning to identify the optimal parameters for the model\n",
    "- By increasing the amount of training data.\n"
