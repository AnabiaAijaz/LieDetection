# Lie Detection based on Audio recordings

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify 30-second audio recordings as truthful or deceptive using the MLEnd Deception Dataset. It was completed as part of the MSc Data Science (Machine Learning coursework) at QMUL – University of London.

The pipeline includes audio segmentation, feature extraction (power, pitch statistics, voiced frame ratio), feature scaling, and supervised learning models such as SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, evaluated using standard classification metrics.

Technologies: Python, Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
